# terraform-aws-dlmautowsnapshot [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/JamesWoolfenden/terraform-aws-dlmautowsnapshot.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/JamesWoolfenden/terraform-aws-dlmautowsnapshot) [![Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/JamesWoolfenden/terraform-aws-dlmautowsnapshot.svg)](https://github.com/JamesWoolfenden/terraform-aws-dlmautowsnapshot/releases/latest)

Terraform module - creates ups data lifecycle management to automate ebs backups.

---

It's 100% Open Source and licensed under the [APACHE2](LICENSE).

## Usage

Include this repository as a module in your existing terraform code:

``` HCL
module "dlmautowsnapshot" {
  source          = "JamesWoolfenden/dlmautowsnapshot/aws"
  version         = "0.0.2"
  common_tags     = "${var.common_tags}"
  snapshot_name   = "${local.snapshot_name}"
  cron_expression = "${var.cron_expression}"
  regions         = "${var.regions}"
}
```

The management of EC2 backup has become simpler With the new release of Data Lifecycle Manager (DLM) policies https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/snapshot-lifecycle.html.
There is no more need for a Lambdas to manage EBS snapshots, and additionally with the new release of support for DLM in Terraform https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/r/dlm_lifecycle_policy.html it can achieved easily.

The example - exampleA shows how to implement a DLM policy on EBS snapshots.
As before you include a reference to the module in your code.

In the example the variable schedule is an extensible list of maps.

```JSON
  schedule = [{
      name = "2 weeks of daily snapshots"
      create_rule=[{
        interval      = 24
        interval_unit = "HOURS"
        times         = ["23:45"]
      }]

      retain_rule=[{
        count = 14
      }]

      tags_to_add {
        SnapshotCreator = "DLM"
      }

      copy_tags = false
    }
]
```

That's all for now.
